# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
This program has a command line interface that allows you to search for a topic on twitter and receive the 100 most recent tweets on that topic. The tweets will be in english and you can filter out retweets to see just tweets people have posted them selves. Under each tweet is a polarity value from -1 to 1 with 1 being very positive and -1 being very negative. There is also a subjectivity value showing how opinionated the text is. The command line also allows you to filter the last 100 to show just very negative tweets and just very positive tweets. Please provide your own twitter API keys
